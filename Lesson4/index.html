          <h2 class="color">Web & UX Design Student</h2>

          <p>As a current Web & UX design student at Wake Tech, I passionately advocate for accessibility, ensuring inclusivity for those with special needs. Believing in the power of technology to bridge gaps for the neurodivergent, I plan to pursue a bachelor's degree in Information Technology next. I am a lifelong learner, committed to continually expanding my skills and knowledge. My passion lies at the intersection of design and tech.</p>
